# Generic class using java

print Integer and String with a single class using Generic.

Today, I give example a small case study about Generic Programming.

I can says that Generic Programming is Powerful. Why? I think just one reason:

"The avoid boilerplate because different type data."

Example:
You want to create class generic.Message with type data "message" is String and Integer. If not use Generic, you make 2 class for String data and Integer data. So, with use that, you just create a class.
